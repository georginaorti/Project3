CO2 and Energy Production Analysis

We wanted to analyze CO2 emissions and energy production in the different regions of the world from 2000 to 2018.
The data set was found online and we used SQLAlchemy to create a flask API so we could have our data set hosted online in order to be called.
The website showing the data visualizations is hosted by Amazon AWS Amplify.

Group members:

Vandan - Created the flask API and hosted the website for the visualizations

Jeff - Filtered and analyzed the data

Michael - Created the dynamic bar chart visualization on the website.

Georgina - Created the dynamic map visualization on the website.
